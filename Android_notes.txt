// Callback Methods

onCreate()
 Called when the activity is first created.
 Upon creation enters the Created state.
 Basic application startup logic are setup once in this onCreate()method.
o For example, instantiating some global or class-scope variables or bind data to lists etc.
 This method receives the parameter savedInstanceState, which holds the previous state
of the activity.

onStart()
 It is invoked by the system when an activity enters the Started state.
 The onStart() call makes the activity visible to the user, as the app prepares for the activity
to enter the foreground and become interactive.
 This is where the app initializes the code that maintains the UI.

onResume()
 When the activity enters the Resumed state, it comes to the foreground, and then
the system invokes the onResume()callback. This is the state in which the app
interacts with the user.
 An app remains in this state until an interruptive event occur
o For instance, user receiving a phone call, the user’s navigating to another
activity, user switch to another app, or the device screen’s turning off.

onPause()
 Invoked when an interruptive event occurs, and the activity enters the Paused state
from Resumed state


onStop()
 An activity enters the Stopped state when it is no longer visible to the user. Then the system
invokes the onStop() callback.
 For example, when a newly launched activity covers the entire screen.
 The system may also call onStop()when the activity has finished running and is
about to be terminated.
 The app should release almost all resources that aren't needed while the user is not using
it.
 In this method, release resources that might leak memory, because it is possible for the
system to kill the process hosting your activity without calling the activity's final
onDestroy()callback.



onDestroy()
 This is final callback in an activity's lifecycle, which is called before an activity is destroyed.
 The system either invokes this callback because
• the activity is finishing when the finish()method is called,
• or the system is temporarily destroying the process containing the activity to save
memory.
 The isFinishing() method is called in onPause() to determine whether the activity
is closing or is just being paused
 The onDestroy()callback releases all resources that have not yet been released by earlier
callbacks such as onStop()
